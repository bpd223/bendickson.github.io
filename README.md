## Superstore Profit and Sales by State

This visualization shows sales and profit by state for a superstore operating in the US. As seen in the data, while the superstore had sales in almost every state in the union, the superstore actually took a loss in many states overall. Their biggest loss was in Texas, where they had a net profit of -$25,729. The superstore faired better in other states such as California, where they  saw a net profit of $76,381.

## College Admissions by Location, Admissions, and Degrees Offered

This visualization shows the levels of admissions, the urbanness, and the highest degree offered at college institutions in the US. The schools are organized into different pages (which can be selected on the right) based on the degree of urbanness. The color of the dots represents the highest degree offered, and the size of the dots represents admissions levels. As can be seen from the visualization, large admissions schools in urban areas tended to offer the highest degrees. However, there are an exceptional amount of outliers in this data set.

## Superstore Sales by state, city, shipping moode, and profit.

In the left side of the visualization, that map depicts superstore profit by state and shipping mode. As can be seen in the map, the most common form of shipping is First Class, by far. Also, you can clearly see the state where the superstore saw the moost profit: California. In the right side visualization, superstore profit by city and product category is depicted. Profit was really low in some states, such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. What can also be seen is that furniture was by far the most popular product sold.

## Group Data Project: ChatGPT and othe rGenerative AI tools' effect on academia at Lehigh
In an email to Lehigh faculty earlier this semester, Provost Nathan Urban said, “In my view, outside of special cases, attempting to ban tools like ChatGPT would be short sighted and likely impossible to enforce.” 

“Students are going to be living and working in a world where these tools are in use and employers and others will expect that their employees generate the best possible work using all the tools available, including generative AI tools,” continued Urban. “So while it may be appropriate to place restrictions on use of these tools in specific cases to meet particular learning objectives, generally we should embrace their use and train our students to be adept and creative in using these and similar tools.”

ChatGPT and other Generative AI tools have thrown a wrench into the world of academia. Since its major release in November of 2022, many in the field have been unsure of how to handle the tool. New York Public Schools have already banned these tools, and just earlier this week, Italy temporarily banned ChatGPT across the country.

Lehigh is taking a different approach towards AI. Instead of banning or restricting the tool, Provost Urban is encouraging the Lehigh community to plant a flag in AI tools and to become a leader in AI technology.

“I want to make sure that we are incorporating them into the way that we think about education. And so that's kind of the key element of this for me because I do think that they will change education and they will also change the way that people work,” said Urban, in an interview. “Lehigh needs to recognize that it needs to incorporate these trends.” 

But given the public backlash about Generative AI tools, are faculty members at Lehigh agreeing with Urban’s messages about these tools?

To gauge faculty response to Generative AI, we sent Lehigh faculty members in the College of Arts and Sciences and P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Sciences an optionally-anonymous survey with a plethora of different questions about these Generative AI tools.

The survey was sent out to department chairs to be sent out to their departments. In total, 34 Lehigh faculty members responded to our survey, 23 from the College of Arts and Sciences and 11 from the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Out of the 34 survey respondents, all of them were aware of Generative AI tools and their availability for students.

College of Engineering and College of Arts and Sciences professors mostly agreed on addressing the use of Generative AI tools in the classroom. Of respondents, almost 85% of them said that they would be addressing AI in the classroom. However, a stark divide started to appear when faculty were asked whether or not they will teach their students about these Generative AI tools. Only 42% of responding faculty planned on teaching their students about AI.

“We need to embrace it and show our students how to use it effectively and ethically to solve problems that matter,” said one respondent. However, there seemed to be much backlash to this idea, with another respondent saying, “ChatGPT is not the most advanced and worthy tool for advancing higher education.

Once more in depth questions started to be asked in the survey, another trend arose: a split on feelings on Generative AI between professors in the College of Engineering and professors from the College of Arts and Sciences.

This split first showed up in the results of the question “Are you currently allowing students to use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tools for assignments out of class?” While seven of the 23 faculty members from the College of Arts and Sciences already banned its use out of class, none of the professors from the College of Engineering had banned its use out of class. In fact, five of the respondents already completely allowed it, and another 2 planned to allow it without any restrictions. The other 4 respondents from the College of Engineering all planned on allowing the out of class use of Generative AI tools.
