## Using Canva to Show NFL Playoff QBs' Passing Scores
I am a very passionate NFL fan and hope to be a sports journalist when I am older, so I chose to look at this year's NFL Playoff QB's and compare them by using their passer scores. Passer score uses data from every pass attempt by a quarterback and analyzes it, giving it a score from 50 (lowest) to 99 (highest). The interesting finding in this infographic is that most quarterbacks were only separated by a small margin. However, there was one huge outlier, which was Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. This was an interesting find, as he was harshly criticized during the season. The data was provided by [ESPN](https://www.nfl.com/news/ranking-the-14-playoff-quarterbacks-based-on-ngs-new-passing-score-metric)

##### Lehigh's Colleges' Undergraduate Enrollment
This graph depicts undergraduate enrollment in Lehigh's different undergraduate colleges. This data was provided by Lehigh University. As seen in the graph, the Arts and Sciences school has by far the largest undergraduate population, and has for years. This is surprising, as Lehigh was founded as an engineering school.

###### NFL Interception Leaders
This graph depicts the NFL's 2021-2022 season interception leaders. This data was provided by the NFL. Matthew Stafford and Trevor Lawrence led the NFL this season with 17 interceptions a piece. However, Lawrence actually played far fewer games, as his team did not make the playoffs. Because of this, Lawrence had the worst interception to game ratio in the league.
