## Using Canva to Show NFL Playoff QBs' Passing Scores
I am a very passionate NFL fan and hope to be a sports journalist when I am older, so I chose to look at this year's NFL Playoff QB's and compare them by using their passer scores. Passer score uses data from every pass attempt by a quarterback and analyzes it, giving it a score from 50 (lowest) to 99 (highest). The interesting finding in this infographic is that most quarterbacks were only separated by a small margin. However, there was one huge outlier, which was Steelers' quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. This was an interesting find, as he was harshly criticized during the season. The data was provided by [ESPN](https://www.nfl.com/news/ranking-the-14-playoff-quarterbacks-based-on-ngs-new-passing-score-metric)

The AFC North is clearly one of the most competitive divisions in the NFL, as shown in this chart.
