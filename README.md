## Group Data Project: ChatGPT and other Generative AI tools' effect on academia at Lehigh
In an email to Lehigh faculty earlier this semester, Provost Nathan Urban said, “In my view, outside of special cases, attempting to ban tools like ChatGPT would be short sighted and likely impossible to enforce.” 

“Students are going to be living and working in a world where these tools are in use and employers and others will expect that their employees generate the best possible work using all the tools available, including generative AI tools,” continued Urban. “So while it may be appropriate to place restrictions on use of these tools in specific cases to meet particular learning objectives, generally we should embrace their use and train our students to be adept and creative in using these and similar tools.”

ChatGPT and other Generative AI tools have thrown a wrench into the world of academia. Since its major release in November of 2022, many in the field have been unsure of how to handle the tool. New York Public Schools have already banned these tools, and just earlier this week, Italy temporarily banned ChatGPT across the country.

Lehigh is taking a different approach towards AI. Instead of banning or restricting the tool, Provost Urban is encouraging the Lehigh community to plant a flag in AI tools and to become a leader in AI technology.

“I want to make sure that we are incorporating them into the way that we think about education. And so that's kind of the key element of this for me because I do think that they will change education and they will also change the way that people work,” said Urban, in an interview. “Lehigh needs to recognize that it needs to incorporate these trends.” 

But given the public backlash about Generative AI tools, are faculty members at Lehigh agreeing with Urban’s messages about these tools?

To gauge faculty response to Generative AI, we sent Lehigh faculty members in the College of Arts and Sciences and P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Sciences an optionally-anonymous survey with a plethora of different questions about these Generative AI tools.

The survey was sent out to department chairs to be sent out to their departments. In total, 34 Lehigh faculty members responded to our survey, 23 from the College of Arts and Sciences and 11 from the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Out of the 34 survey respondents, all of them were aware of Generative AI tools and their availability for students.

College of Engineering and College of Arts and Sciences professors mostly agreed on addressing the use of Generative AI tools in the classroom. Of respondents, almost 85% of them said that they would be addressing AI in the classroom. However, a stark divide started to appear when faculty were asked whether or not they will teach their students about these Generative AI tools. Only 42% of responding faculty planned on teaching their students about AI.

“We need to embrace it and show our students how to use it effectively and ethically to solve problems that matter,” said one respondent. However, there seemed to be much backlash to this idea, with another respondent saying, “ChatGPT is not the most advanced and worthy tool for advancing higher education.

Once more in depth questions started to be asked in the survey, another trend arose: a split on feelings on Generative AI between professors in the College of Engineering and professors from the College of Arts and Sciences.

This split first showed up in the results of the question “Are you currently allowing students to use ChatGPT or other Generative AI tools for assignments out of class?” While seven of the 23 faculty members from the College of Arts and Sciences already banned its use out of class, none of the professors from the College of Engineering had banned its use out of class. In fact, five of the respondents already completely allowed it, and another 2 planned to allow it without any restrictions. The other 4 respondents from the College of Engineering all planned on allowing the out of class use of Generative AI tools.

## Allowment of AI out of Class

In the classroom, the divide between colleges still exists.  While seven of 11 professors in the College of Engineering are allowing the use of Generative AI tools in their classes to some degree, only eight of 23 professors surveyed in the College of Arts and Sciences allowed its use in class.

So, why does this divide between colleges exist? In the college of Arts and Sciences, many faculty members were worried about how Generative AI tools would effect the process of creativity and the process of writing. AI can help students generate ideas that they would not have otherwise, worrying faculty about creative processes.

“The reason why I have not included it robustly in my teaching is that the greatest skill students can learn in my courses is the combination of original critical analysis and expression/argumentation,” said one anonymous respondent. “In my own experience, working with ChatGPT exercises very different skills, such as giving clear directions, recursive evaluation and revision, and persistence. These may be valuable but can be learned better in other settings than in my classes. My expertise is best used teaching students how to read thoughtfully, analyze problems, and express their positions.”

Another professor, who teaches a class heavy in writing, said, “Writing is about discovery, not about translating pre-formed ideas to words. It is by means of writing that you discover what you think, or why what you thought doesn't quite work, or a facet of an idea that you hadn't thought about before. Generative AI replaces the writing process. That’s a problem.”

Professor Bauknight, an English professor, is more interested in how Generative AI tools can be used to help learners, rather than replace the writing process. He has shared the tool in class with his English 002 students and mentions in the syllabus, “you are not allowed to use [Generative AI] technologies to write your assignments for you.” However, students may use these tools, “in other ways that you find helpful for your learning process (brainstorming, for example),” as long as students cite the tool and explain how it was used.

Bauknight also acknowledges a ban on Generative AI noting that, “there are always going to be restrictions in schools that won’t be there in the world, but these restrictions are necessary.” For some disciplines, the use of Generative AI might not be compatible with learning goals. 

In the College of Engineering, while the results of the survey show that Generative AI is overall being more allowed than in other colleges at Lehigh, the free response sections of the survey reveal that it may not be because of how effective these tools are. Many professors from the Engineering department seemed to believe that AI tools still had far to go and that they were not too useful for their field yet, meaning that they really had no effect on their classes.

“I do not implement its use; I just don't fight it,” said one professor from the Engineering department, while another said, “I don't generally operate by prohibiting, but I have been showing students how AI gets things wrong in various ways.”

Faculty members were then asked about if and how they will be changing teaching and evaluation methods due to Generative AI tools. In the changing of teaching methodology, again Arts and Sciences professors were much more likely to change the way that their classroom operates. One professor from the department went as far as saying, “I'm shifting certain assignments off-line, including handwritten hour quizzes.”

## Changing of Teaching Methods

However, Professor Ginny McSwain, Professor of Physics here at Lehigh, says that at some point these tools will need to be embraced in teaching. “Students are going to use it, whether we ban it or not, just like they already use other prohibited sites (e.g. Chegg),” McSwain said. “We need to be prepared to work with it or at least work around it.”

Engineering professors again seemed unworried about AI forcing them to change teaching methods. While they tend to recognize that it has an impact, overall they see the impact as very small on their field. “The classes I teach can benefit from ChatGPT and generative AI," said an anonymous respondent from the College of Engineering. I will include them and encourage their use, but so much of the assignments I give requires hands on, experiential work, that won't be impacted (yet) by AI tools in their final form, just on the ideation front.

Out of the faculty interviewed, only just over 31% of respondents said that they would change the way that they evaluate students. However, almost all these professors were in the College of Arts and Sciences. Only one professor surveyed from the College of Engineering planned on changing their evaluation methods.

## Will you change evaluation methods?

“Increased human to human interaction in assessment is a way to prohibit students relying on AI to complete their learning tasks,” said one respondent from the College of Arts and Sciences, while another said, “Take-home writing is less trustworthy; I may require to see multiple drafts of take-home writing.”

Of professors who were surveyed, the most common ways that evaluation methods were being changed were with an increase in oral examinations, higher percentage of class grades decided by participation, and an increase in in-class writing assignments.

Engineering professors again seemed unworried about evaluation, with one faculty member saying, “Most of the deliverables for my class are physical output, not written output, thus there is little fear AI tools can be used to"cheat "."

One of the last questions on the survey directly addressed Provost Urban’s message of Lehigh being a leader in and wanting to plant a flag in AI. When respondents were prompted with the question “Lehigh’s provost has expressed Lehigh’s desire to become a leader in Generative AI and encourage its use in the classroom. Do you think this is a good idea?,” only about 45% of respondents agreed with the provost’s message.

Clearly, two major divides on Generative AI tools still exist at Lehigh: the divide between the provost office and faculty, and the divide between separate colleges at Lehigh. While 
Provost Urban has strived to get these tools implemented early in classrooms and for Lehigh to get a front foot on AI technology such as ChatGPT, the survey results show the level of disdain he has been met with.

“Faculty ultimately have a lot of decision-making power over how they teach and how they assess,” Urban said. He also brought up how many teachers might think they know the full extent of these tools, but in practice he has seen professors be stunned by what these tools can truly do. In one specific instance, Urban had approached a coding professor about the use of AI in code. While the professor knew that AI wrote essays and could answer math equations, “they weren’t aware that it writes code, too,” Urban said.  “And I think it's important to make sure that faculty are broadly aware of the kinds of use cases of these tools so that they can think about how it is best to incorporate them into a classroom and into assignments.” 

One major trend that is seen in the faculty survey that was also talked about in the interview with Provost Urban was uncertainty about these Generative AI tools. For example, in the survey question “Lehigh’s provost has expressed Lehigh’s desire to become a leader in Generative AI and encourage its use in the classroom. Do you think this is a good idea?,” over 31% of respondents said “it depends”, and in a free response section about changing of evaluation methods, 12 of the 34 respondents said that they need more information before making any decisions about Generative AI.

These trends worry Urban, as a situation in which there is faculty and student uncertainty about the allowment of AI tools is a dangerous one. To combat this, Urban has urged teachers not to ban AI tools yet. 

On top of combating confusion, Urban also wants teachers to avoid banning it because he wants students to have access to the best tools possible. “These (Generative AI tools) change the way that we think about education, I think that's kind of been the key element to me,” Urban said. “And I want to make sure that we're doing this in a way that is effective, that is presenting students with the way that these things are going to be used in the real world.”

No matter what your specific opinion on Generative AI tools, one main theme emerged from the survey, faculty interviews, and the interview with the provost: Generative AI technology will have an effect on academia at Lehigh.

“I believe AI will be useful for research and teaching at Lehigh,” said one anonymous survey respondent. “Lehigh should think hard and fast how to use it in the most effective and productive way.”
